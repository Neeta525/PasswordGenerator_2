# Password Generator
## Description
This is a password generator that uses prompts, alerts and confirm window boxes. The user can choose the length of their password beteween 8 and 128 characters and decide what they want to include in their password such as upper case letters, lower case, numbers and special characters. This was created to satify a homework requirment for week three of coding bootcamp. It served as a way to put JavaSript skills into practice. Still being very new to JavaScript I found parts of this assignment challenging particulary getting it to choose only the characters chosen by the user.
